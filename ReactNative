React Navigation -> https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started
  * React Native doesn't have a built-in API for navigation like a web browser does. React Navigation provides this for you, along with the iOS and Android gestures and animations to transition between screens.
  * Stack.Navigator is a component that takes route configuration as its children with additional props for configuration and renders our content.
  * Each Stack.Screen component takes a name prop which refers to the name of the route and component prop which specifies the component to render for the route. These are the 2 required props.
  * To specify what the initial route in a stack is, provide an initialRouteName as the prop for the navigator.
  * To specify screen-specific options, we can pass an options prop to Stack.Screen, and for common options, we can pass screenOptions to Stack.Navigator
